# Ft_Printf

## Description

This project is part of the 42 Common Core curriculum.
The goal was to reimplement one of the most commonly used functions in C — printf — and understand how it works behind the scenes.

Throughout the project, I learned how to handle a variable number of arguments using the stdarg.h library, and how to properly format and print different data types such as characters, strings, integers, and hexadecimal values.

## Usage

Clone the repository:  

```  
git clone https://github.com/Eumaxion/ft_printf.git
cd ft_printf 

```
Compile the mandatory part:  
```make```

To clean object files:  
```make clean```

To remove all binaries:  
```make fclean```

To rebuild everything:  
```make re```
## Skills Developed

Variadic functions (va_start, va_arg, va_end)  
String and number formatting  
Modular and clean C code organization  
Efficient buffer management  
Static library creation with Makefile
## Status

Project: Complete  
Final Grade: 100/100
